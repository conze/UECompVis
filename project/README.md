# Optical Flow–Based Video Editing

This repository provides a Python framework for dense and long-term motion estimation
applied to video editing.

## Context
Computer Vision course project.

## Objectives
- Estimate dense optical flow in video sequences
- Integrate motion over time (long-term)
- Propagate a manual edit across a video using motion fields

## Structure
See `src/` for the main pipeline.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Disclaimer
This code is provided as a baseline for educational purposes.
Students are expected to analyze its limitations and propose improvements.
